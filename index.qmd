Kudzai here, I am an international student from the beautiful Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Born and

raised there I moved to the US about two years ago (time flies) to pursue tertiary education at

Macalester College. I consider myself an ambitious and optimistic person. I spend quite a bit of

time in a utopian future that I have created for myself in my head. This is not entirely a bad thing

because these goals and visions are what motivate me to work hard every single day. I call it

intrinsic motivation. I am also a very social person but I also believe in authentic and genuine

relationships. I enjoy talking about and playing various kinds of sports although soccer tops the

list. Other topics that really interest me and you will probably spot me talking about are African

politics, economics, business, and music.
