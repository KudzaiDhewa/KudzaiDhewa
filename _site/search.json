    "text": "Kudzai here, I am an international student from the beautiful Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Born and\nraised there I moved to the US about two years ago (time flies) to pursue tertiary education at\nMacalester College. I consider myself an ambitious and optimistic person. I spend quite a bit of\ntime in a utopian future that I have created for myself in my head. This is not entirely a bad thing\nbecause these goals and visions are what motivate me to work hard every single day. I call it\nintrinsic motivation. I am also a very social person but I also believe in authentic and genuine\nrelationships. I enjoy talking about and playing various kinds of sports although soccer tops the\nlist. Other topics that really interest me and you will probably spot me talking about are African\npolitics, economics, business, and music."
